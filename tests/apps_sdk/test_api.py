"""Tests for Apps SDK API endpoints.

Tests cover:
- Health check endpoint
- Widget serving endpoint (via direct route testing)
- Widget asset serving

Note: The MCP session manager has a limitation where it can only be run once
per instance, which makes it difficult to test with TestClient. We use
direct route testing for widget endpoints to avoid this limitation.
