## 1. Updated Technology Stack Table

| Category | Technology | Version | Purpose | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Primary LLM** | **NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Nano-30B** | **v3 (Dec 2025)** | Agent Core Logic | Sparse MoE design for high inference throughput. |
| **Language** | Python | **3.12+** | Backend logic & NAT | Native NAT and NeMo runtime support. |
| **Agentic Framework** | NeMo Agent Toolkit | 1.3.1+ | Multi-agent workflows | Built-in support for tool-calling and reasoning trace. |
| **Inference Engine** | **NVIDIA NIM / TensorRT-LLM** | 25.11+ | Optimized Execution | Configurable: local Docker or public NVIDIA API endpoint. |
| **Client Agent Simulator** | Static Simulator | n/a | Client simulator | Simulates product search ("find t-shirts") → displays 4 products → user clicks to start ACP checkout. |
| **Client UI Framework** | React | 18+ | Multi-panel Inspector UI | Component model for three-panel Protocol Inspector (Agent/Business/CoT views). |
| **Client App Framework** | Next.js | 14+ | Client UI | App Router for the simulator UI + Multi-Panel Protocol Inspector. |
| **Component Library** | shadcn/ui | latest | Client UI | Modern accessible primitives to build a polished demo UI fast. |
| **Payments (PSP)** | PSP service + SQLite | demo | Delegated payments | Vault token minting (`vt_...`), idempotency, payment intents (`pi_...`) that consume tokens. |

### NIM Deployment Configuration

The inference engine is **configurable** via environment variables:

```env
# Option 1: NVIDIA hosted API
NIM_ENDPOINT=https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
NIM_API_KEY=nvapi-xxx

# Option 2: Local Docker container
NIM_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8000/v1
NIM_API_KEY=local
```

---

### PSP DB schema (demo)

- **Tables**
  - **`vault_tokens`**: `id (vt_...)`, `created`, `payment_method (json)`, `allowance (json: max_amount, currency, expires_at, merchant_id, reason=one_time, checkout_session_id)`, `risk_signals (json)`, `metadata (json)`, `idempotency_key (unique)`, `request_id`, `status (active|consumed)`
  - **`idempotency_store`**: `idempotency_key (pk)`, `request_hash`, `response_status`, `response_body`, `created_at`
  - **`payment_intents`**: `id (pi_...)`, `vault_token_id (fk)`, `status (pending→completed)`, `amount`, `currency`, `merchant_id?`, `metadata?`, `created`, `completed_at?`

- **Lifecycle**
  - `vault_tokens.status`: **active** → **consumed** after a successful `payment_intents` creation/processing.

## 2. Strategic LLM Implementation Details

The **Nemotron-3-Nano** model provides three key capabilities that directly support our ACP requirements:

* **Reasoning Trace (Thinking Mode):** The model natively generates a "reasoning trace" before concluding. We will pipe this trace directly to the **"Protocol Inspector" UI** to show exactly *how* the Promotion Agent decided to beat a competitor's price.
* **Agentic Tool Use:** This model is fine-tuned for **multi-step tool use**. It will excel at our **SQLiteQueryTool**, translating natural language intents into the precise SQL joins we defined earlier.
* **Multilingual Native Support:** It supports English, Spanish, and French natively. This allows the **Post-Purchase Agent** to generate shipping updates in the user's preferred language without needing a separate translation layer.

Additionally, the **Client Agent Simulator** uses static, pre-defined flows with a hardcoded catalog of 4 products to simulate user-like behavior:
1. User enters a search prompt (e.g., "find some t-shirts")
2. Simulator displays 4 product cards with images and prices
3. User clicks on a product to initiate the ACP checkout flow

## 4. Latency Guardrail (LLM Optimization)

To ensure fast response times (target <10s for typical operations):

* **Parallel Execution:** We will leverage `asyncio` to prompt the Nemotron instances simultaneously for the Promotion and Recommendation tasks.
* **Quantization (FP8):** We will use the **FP8 quantized version** of the model to achieve up to **3.3× higher throughput** compared to dense models, ensuring rapid responses.

## 5. Global Webhook Configuration

Post-purchase events (shipping updates, order status changes) are delivered to a **single global webhook URL** configured at the application level:

```env
WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-client.example.com/webhooks/acp
WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
```

The Post-Purchase Agent publishes events to this endpoint using the configured **Brand Persona**.
